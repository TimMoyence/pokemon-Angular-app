# To start the projet and create a project 

`ng new ng-pokemon-app-V2 --no-standalone --routing --ssr false --minimal --style=css`

`ng new`: This is the command to create a new Angular project.
`ng-pokemon-app-V2`: This is the name you've given to your project. You can replace it with any name you prefer.
`--no-standalone`: This flag indicates that you don't want to create a standalone application. Standalone applications are typically used when you want to build a complete, independent Angular application.
`--routing`: This flag includes Angular Router in your project. Angular Router is used for navigation and creating a Single Page Application (SPA) structure.
`--ssr false:` This flag disables Server-Side Rendering (SSR). SSR is used to render Angular applications on the server side, providing better initial page load performance.
`--minimal`: This flag creates a minimal project structure. It's useful when you want to start with a bare minimum and add features as needed.
`--style=css`: This flag sets the default styling language to CSS. Angular supports different styling languages like CSS, SCSS, and others.
